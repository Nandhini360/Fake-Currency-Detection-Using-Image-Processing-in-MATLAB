# Fake Currency Detection Using Image Processing in MATLAB

This project detects fake currency notes using image processing techniques in MATLAB.

## How It Works

1. **Load an image** of a currency note.
2. **Process the image** to extract features (such as color, texture, or security marks).
3. **Compare the features** with those of genuine notes.
4. **Display the result**: Genuine or Fake.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (with Image Processing Toolbox)
- Images of real and fake currency notes

## How to Use

1. Place images of currency notes in a folder.
2. Run the main script in MATLAB:
    ```matlab
    final code.m
    ```
3. Follow the instructions to select an image and see the result.

## Files

- `final code.m` – Main script
- `Feature Dataset` – Folder for Dataset of Fetures
- `Original Notes` - Folder for Original Currency Notes
- `Fake Notes` - Folder for fake Currency Notes
